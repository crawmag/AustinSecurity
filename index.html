                <h2>Highly Recommend</h2>
                <p>Huge shout out to Patrick at Central Security. 
                    Over the years, I've called the company 
                    2 or 3 times, and they've always helped 
                    troubleshoot my equipment either via 
                    phone or in person. They've never tried 
                    to upsell me on anything, and they are 
                    always friendly and available. Rates are 
                    very reasonable too! Highly recommend to 
                    anyone in the Austin area</p>

                <h2>Customer for 8 Years</h2>
                <p>I've been a customer now for almost 8 
                    years now, and I have received nothing 
                    but the best service and monitoring from 
                    Central Security. Russell installed the 
                    system in our first house in NW Austin.  
                    When we moved out to the middle of nowhere 
                    outside of Liberty Hill I thought I would 
                    just have to go without alarm service, 
                    but Central Security came through.  
                    They were even able to set me up with a 
                    wireless system I can control remotely. 
                    Thanks Russell and the rest of the 
                    Central Security team!</p>
